    "Summaries of counterfactual examples can be used to estimate importance of features. Intuitively, a feature that is changed more often to generate a proximal counterfactual is an important feature. We use this intuition to build a feature importance score. \n",
    "\n",
    "This score can be interpreted as a measure of the **necessity** of a feature to cause a particular model output. That is, if the feature's value changes, then it is likely that the model's output class will also change (or the model's output will significantly change in case of regression model).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show how counterfactuals can be used to provide local feature importance scores for any input, and how those scores can be combined to yield a global importance score for each feature."
