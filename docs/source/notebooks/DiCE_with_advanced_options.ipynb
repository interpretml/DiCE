For instance, one way is to use the mean absolute deviation from the median as a measure of relative difficulty of changing a continuous feature.\n",

The inverse of MAD would then imply the ease of varying the feature and is hence used as feature weights in our optimization to reflect the difficulty of changing a continuous feature. By default, DiCE computes this internally and divides the distance between continuous features by the MAD of the feature's values in the training set. Let's see what their values are by computing them below:"

    "Note that we transform continuous features and one-hot-encode categorical features to fall between 0 and 1 in order to handle relative scale of features. However, this also means that the relative ease of changing continuous features is higher than categorical features when the total number of continuous features are very less compared to the total number of categories of all categorical variables combined. This is reflected in the above table where continuous features (*age* and *hours_per_week*) have been varied to reach their extreme values (*range of age: [17, 90]*; *range of hours_per_week: [1, 99]*) for most of the counterfactuals. This is the reason why the distances are divided by a scaling factor. Deviation from the median provides a robust measure of the variability of a featureâ€™s values, and thus dividing by the MAD allows us to capture the relative prevalence of observing the feature at a particular value (see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07697.pdf) for more details)."
