Explanations are critical for machine learning, especially as machine learning-based systems are being used to inform decisions in societally critical domains such as finance, healthcare, education, and criminal justice.
However, most explanation methods depend on an approximation of the ML model to
create an interpretable explanation. For example,
consider a person who applied for a loan and was rejected by the loan distribution algorithm of a financial company. Typically, the company may provide an explanation on why the loan was rejected, for example, due to "poor credit history". However, such an explanation does not help the person decide *what they do should next* to improve their chances of being approved in the future. Critically, the most important feature may not be enough to flip the decision of the algorithm, and in practice, may not even be changeable such as gender and race.


DiCE implements `counterfactual (CF) explanations <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00399>`_  that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., ``you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000``. In other words, it provides "what-if" explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.

Barring simple linear models, however, it is difficult to generate CF examples that work for any machine learning model. DiCE is based on `recent research <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07697>`_ that generates CF explanations for any ML model. The core idea is to setup finding such explanations as an optimization problem, similar to finding adversarial examples. The critical difference is that for explanations, we need perturbations that change the output of a machine learning model, but are also diverse and feasible to change. Therefore, DiCE supports generating a set of counterfactual explanations  and has tunable parameters for diversity and proximity of the explanations to the original input. It also supports simple constraints on features to ensure feasibility of the generated counterfactual examples.


Installing DICE
-----------------
DiCE supports Python 3+. To install the latest version of DiCE and its dependencies, run this from the top-most folder of the repo:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e .

If you face any problems, try installing dependencies manually.

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

DiCE requires the following packages:

* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* h5py
* tensorflow (We use DiCE with `TensorFlow 1.13.0-rc1 <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.13.0-rc1>`_ in the notebooks, however, it works with Tensorflow>=1.13 and PyTorch as well.)

The stable version of DiCE is now available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/dice-ml/>`_.

.. code:: bash

    pip install dice-ml

Getting started with DiCE
-------------------------
With DiCE, generating explanations is a simple three-step  process: train
mode and then invoke DiCE to generate counterfactual examples for any input.

.. code:: python

    import dice_ml
    from dice_ml.utils import helpers # helper functions
    # Dataset for training an ML model
    d = dice_ml.Data(dataframe=helpers.load_adult_income_dataset(),
                     continuous_features=['age', 'hours_per_week'],
                     outcome_name='income')
    # Pre-trained ML model
    m = dice_ml.Model(model_path=dice_ml.utils.helpers.get_adult_income_modelpath())
    # DiCE explanation instance
    exp = dice_ml.Dice(d,m)

For any given input, we can now generate counterfactual explanations. For
example, the following input leads to class 0 (low income).

.. code:: python

    query_instance = {'age':22,
        'workclass':'Private',
        'education':'HS-grad',
        'marital_status':'Single',
        'occupation':'Service',
        'race': 'White',
        'gender':'Female',
        'hours_per_week': 45}

Using DiCE, we can now generate examples that would have been classified as class 1 (high income).

.. code:: python

    # Generate counterfactual examples
    dice_exp = exp.generate_counterfactuals(query_instance, total_CFs=4, desired_class="opposite")
    # Visualize counterfactual explanation
    dice_exp.visualize_as_dataframe()

Supported use-cases
-------------------
**Data**

DiCE does not need access to the full dataset. It only requires metadata properties for each feature (min, max for continuous features and levels for categorical features). Thus, for sensitive data, the dataset can be provided as:

.. code:: python

    d = data.Data(features={
                       'age':[17, 90],
                       'workclass': ['Government', 'Other/Unknown', 'Private', 'Self-Employed'],
                       'education': ['Assoc', 'Bachelors', 'Doctorate', 'HS-grad', 'Masters', 'Prof-school', 'School', 'Some-college'],
                       'marital_status': ['Divorced', 'Married', 'Separated', 'Single', 'Widowed'],
                       'occupation':['Blue-Collar', 'Other/Unknown', 'Professional', 'Sales', 'Service', 'White-Collar'],
                       'race': ['Other', 'White'],
                       'gender':['Female', 'Male'],
                       'hours_per_week': [1, 99]},
             outcome_name='income')

**Model**

We support pre-trained models as well as training a model using Tensorflow. Here's a simple example.

.. code:: python

    sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
    # Generating train and test data
    train, _ = d.split_data(d.normalize_data(d.one_hot_encoded_data))
    X_train = train.loc[:, train.columns != 'income']
    y_train = train.loc[:, train.columns == 'income']
    # Fitting a dense neural network model
    ann_model = keras.Sequential()
    ann_model.add(keras.layers.Dense(20, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l1(0.001), activation=tf.nn.relu))
    ann_model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid))
    ann_model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01), metrics=['accuracy'])
    ann_model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_split=0.20, epochs=100, verbose=0, class_weight={0:1,1:2})

    # Generate the DiCE model for explanation
    m = model.Model(model=ann_model)

**Explanations**

We visualize explanations through a table highlighting the change in features. We plan to support an English language explanation too!

Feasibility of counterfactual explanations
-------------------------------------------
We acknowledge that not all counterfactual explanations may be feasible for a
user. In general, counterfactuals closer to an individual's profile will be
more feasible. Diversity is also important to help an individual choose between
multiple possible options.

DiCE provides tunable parameters for diversity and proximity to generate
different kinds of explanations.

.. code:: python

    dice_exp = exp.generate_counterfactuals(query_instance,
                    total_CFs=4, desired_class="opposite",
                    proximity_weight=1.5, diversity_weight=1.0)

Additionally, it may be the case that some features are harder to change than
others (e.g., education level is harder to change than working hours per week). DiCE allows input of relative difficulty in changing a feature through specifying *feature weights*. A higher feature weight means that the feature is harder to change than others. For instance, one way is to use the mean absolute deviation from the median as a measure of relative difficulty of changing a continuous feature. By default, DiCE computes this internally and divides the distance between continuous features by the MAD of the feature's values in the training set. We can also assign different values through the *feature_weights* parameter. 

.. code:: python

    # assigning new weights
    feature_weights = {'age': 10, 'hours_per_week': 5}
    # Now generating explanations using the new feature weights
    dice_exp = exp.generate_counterfactuals(query_instance,
                    total_CFs=4, desired_class="opposite",
                    feature_weights=feature_weights)

Finally, some features are impossible to change such as one's age or race. Therefore, DiCE also allows inputting a
list of features to vary.

.. code:: python

    dice_exp = exp.generate_counterfactuals(query_instance,
                    total_CFs=4, desired_class="opposite",
                    features_to_vary=['age','workclass','education','occupation','hours_per_week'])

It also supports simple constraints on
features that reflect practical constraints (e.g., working hours per week
cannot be more than 50).

The promise of counterfactual explanations
-------------------------------------------
Being truthful to the model, counterfactual explanations can be useful to all stakeholders for a decision made by a machine learning model that makes decisions.

* **Decision subjects**: Counterfactual explanations can be used to explore actionable recourse for a person based on a decision received by a ML model. DiCE shows decision outcomes with *actionable* alternative profiles, to help people understand what they could have done to change their model outcome.

* **ML model developers**: Counterfactual explanations are also useful for model developers to debug their model for potential problems. DiCE can be used to show CF explanations for a selection of inputs that can uncover if there are any problematic (in)dependences on some features (e.g., for 95% of inputs, changing features X and Y change the outcome, but not for the other 5%). We aim to support aggregate metrics to help developers debug ML models.

* **Decision makers**: Counterfactual explanations may be useful to
  decision-makers such as doctors or judges who may use ML models to make decisions. For a particular individual, DiCE allows probing the ML model to see the possible changes that lead to a different ML outcome, thus enabling decision-makers to assess their trust in the prediction.

* **Decision evaluators**: Finally, counterfactual explanations can be useful
  to decision evaluators who may be interested in fairness or other desirable
  properties of an ML model. We plan to add support for this in the future.


Roadmap
-------
Ideally, counterfactual explanations should balance between a wide range of suggested changes (*diversity*), and the relative ease of adopting those changes (*proximity* to the original input), and also follow the causal laws of the world, e.g., one can hardly lower their educational degree or change their race.

We are working on adding the following features to DiCE:

* Incorporating causal constraints when generating counterfactual explanations (check out `feasible-CF branch <https://github.com/microsoft/DiCE/tree/feasible-cf>`_)
* Support for scikit-learn and other libraries where models are not necessarily differentiable
* Support for using DiCE for debugging machine learning models
* Support for other algorithms for generating counterfactual explanations
